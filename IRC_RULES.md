# Channel Rules

- Respect — don't engage in racism or hate speech. People are entitled to different opinions.

- Appropriate — think before you type, is your comment appropriate? Is it possible someone may misinterpret what you're saying in jest as hateful speech?
- Keep it on topic — personal attacks, trolling/baiting or flooding (posting multiple repetitive lines or large amounts of code) of the channel will not be tolerated.
- To paste more than 2 lines in a row, use a pastebin service like https://gnu.cat/write (spammers will be banned on sight)
- On-topic discussions take priority over off-topic chit-chat. If somoene needs help, assist them the best you can.

# Abuse will not be tolerated
IRC is not the exclusive playground of a few select individuals. Bans can be applied to a channel, or to all channels based on the severity or frequency of the abuses, at the discretion of the channel operators.

Before you are banned, you will often be warned by an operator first, however this is not always practical and an operator may deem it unnecessary if a user has recently been kicked or banned.

In an ideal world, there would be no need for IRC operators, but instead of trying to blame operators for this, blame the users who are not willing to be decent humans.

*Channel rules can and will be updated without prior notice exclusively at the channel operators discretion.
